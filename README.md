## Project  -  Data Analysis of haematological variables
This project focused on the utilization of PCA and CA to perform dimensionality reduction and evaluate the relationships between data instances.

### Data:
The data was provided in an excel file and contains 6 variables:
- HGLB, which refers to the concentration of haemoglobin (an oxygen-carrying protein) in a given volumetric quantity of blood
- VGLOB, which refers to the ratio of cells found in a given volumetric quantity of blood
- GBR, which refers to white blood cell count
- LINF, which stands for lymphocyte count, a white blood cell
- NEUTR, which stands for the neutrophil count, another type of white blood cell
- CCSER, which stands for Serum lead concentration

### Project Objectives:
- Make a preliminary analysis of the data
- Conduct PCA and interpret results and the principal components
- Conduct hierarchical CA and interpret results
- Compare the results obtained from PCA and CA
